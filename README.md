## cubiquity-check
This collection of code is part of Erica and Katerina's project for Georgia Tech's REU (https://jonathansimone.math.gatech.edu/reu2023.html). We aim to distinguish cubiquitous and non-cubiquitous lattices by performing various obstructions.

### checkmod.py
checkmod.py contains all of the functions that can be used to generate specific basis for lattices, compute determinant and the Wu element, generate and check cubes for cubiquity, and more. See comments for more detail.
